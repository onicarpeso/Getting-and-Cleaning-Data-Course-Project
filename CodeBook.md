Original description of the dataset: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The tidy dataset described in this Code Book was created after extracting the original data source and using the following files:

 - ‘features_info.txt’: Shows information about the variables used on
   the feature vector.
 - ‘activity_labels.txt’: Links the class labels
   with their activity name.
 - ‘train/X_train.txt’: Training set.
 - ‘train/y_train.txt’: Training labels. ‘test/X_test.txt’: Test set.
 - ‘test/y_test.txt’: Test labels.
 - ‘train/subject_train.txt’: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

Note: Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
